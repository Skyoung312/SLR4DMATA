# Open-Source Repository for "Systematic Literature Review and Beyond: Extracting Foundational Knowledge for Intelligent Distributed Multi-Agent Task Allocation"
This is the open-source repository for our paper, "Systematic Literature Review and Beyond: Extracting Foundational Knowledge for Intelligent Distributed Multi-Agent Task Allocation," which is currently under journal review.

In this article, we employed a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** methodology to comprehensively examine and filter **Distributed Multi-Agent Task Allocation (DMATA)** techniques within **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**. This process ultimately yielded 86 research papers from five commonly used computer science databases as evidence.

## Repository Structure
The structure of this repository is as follows:

* The `Literature` folder provides the original PDF full-text of all 86 articles, organized by database source.
* The `Results and Dataset` file contains two worksheets:
    * The `Results` worksheet presents the raw data on **problem types**, **method types**, and **evaluation metrics** for all these articles (corresponding to RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3, respectively).
    * The `Dataset` worksheet provides the extracted **problem descriptions**, **solutions**, and **evaluations** for each of the 86 articles (corresponding to Section V-D of our paper).

## Purpose of the Dataset

The primary purpose of providing this dataset is to offer readers key information for each paper, facilitating quick reference and comparison of different DMATA problems, methods, and their evaluations. Furthermore, another objective is to leverage this systematic knowledge—beneficial for DMATA problem-solving—to promote future knowledge reuse and LLM-driven automation in this field.
